# Airport Management System with customized Dijkstra algorithm.

## Problem
In a surreal scenario, you find yourself as the esteemed leader of the illustrious Blue Light planet. Within the vast expanse of this celestial body, an abundance of minerals and resources flow endlessly, painting a picture of prosperity.
However, amidst the dreamscape, a monumental task presents itself: constructing an airport system for the radiant Light planet:
- Airport Identification (ID)
- Cost Between Two Airports (weight)
- Airport Types (L, M, S)

In addition to the airports, a network of flights will connect the various destinations across the planet. These flights, essential conduits of travel, boast the following characteristics:
- Departure and Destination
- Aircraft Type (L, M, S).
  
Note: Define (L > M > S) so that Aircraft that have type is greater cannot land to the airport that have type is smaller.
 
## Project Overview
This project is part of the Data Structures and Algorithms course at [FPT University HCMC]. The goal of this assignment is to implement a data struture for airport system management and apply Dijkstra algorithm that has been customizing to 
solve the problem conditions.  
The project has the following features:

1. **Add an airport**
2. **Add a route**
3. **Delete an airport**
4. **Delete a route**
5. **Update an airport**
6. **List airports and their networks**
7. **Calculate cost**
8. **Find the shortest route**
9. **Boomb!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!**
